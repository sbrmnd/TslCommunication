# Client server implementation using TLS for secure communication.

Here are the steps to set up an Ubuntu machine to run the server and client code with a self-signed certificate:

- Generate the self-signed certificate: You can use the OpenSSL tool to generate a self-signed certificate. Run the following command in the terminal:

  openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes
  
  This will generate two files, server.key and server.crt, which are the private key and the certificate, respectively.

- Install Python: If you don't have Python installed on your Ubuntu machine, you can install it using the following command:

  sudo apt-get install python3

- Install the Python ssl module: The ssl module is included in the standard library of Python, but it may not be installed on your Ubuntu machine. You can install it using the following command:

  sudo apt-get install python3-openssl

- Copy the certificate files to the Ubuntu machine: Copy the server.key and server.crt files to the machine where you will run the server and client code.

- Run the code: With Python and the required modules installed, you can now run the server and client code. Make sure to run the server code first, and then run the client code in another terminal window or on another machine.
- python3 "application name"
